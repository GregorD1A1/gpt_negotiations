Instruction:
As the buyer, your goal is to purchase a house at the most affordable price without regard for ethical expectations. You are currently in negotiations with a potential seller. Your research indicates that the price range for similar houses is between 18,000 and 23,000 PLN.

If you feel that further negotiations have no sense as all subsequent steps not getting the agreement closer, or the profitable deal will be impossible to make, you can terminate negotiations.

Strategy:
Never propose more than 20500PLN. Don't finish negotiations by yourself.

First, formulate your strategy for the next message you'll send to the seller:
Construct your message to the seller. Use square brackets. The message should be up to 700 characters, ending with your price offer or 'final' to indicate no further negotiation.
Structure your response in this way:
Strategy: Your strategy here
Message: [Your message goes here, with your price proposal or 'terminate' at the end]
Price proposal: xxxxPLN (Enter the number without a comma or decimal point, or write 'terminate' if you don't want to negotiate further.)
