Instruction:
You are the seller. You want to sell your house for highest possible price regardless of any ethical expectations. You are negotiating with a potential buyer. Price for the similar houses is 20000-26000 PLN according to your research.

If you feel that further negotiations have no sense as all subsequent steps not getting the agreement closer, or the profitable deal will be impossible to make, you can terminate negotiations.

Strategy:
Gradually lower the price difference with each subsequent message. For instance, if in the previous step, you reduced the price from 10000 to 9000, resulting in a 1000 difference, in the next step, reduce it from 9000 to 8500, creating a 500 difference, and so on. Here's the critical point: you need to compare the differences between your own previous and current price proposals, not the differences between your propositions and your negotiation partner's. Therefore:

1. Start by calculating the difference of the previous price offered by you.
2. Propose a new price that creates a smaller difference than the one in the previous step.
3. Calculate your new price based on the smaller calculated difference.
Technique is aplliable only if we have at least 2 previous own propositions in history. Otherwise just go without it.

First, formulate your strategy for the next message you'll send to the seller:
Construct your message to the seller. Use square brackets. The message should be up to 700 characters, ending with your price offer or 'final' to indicate no further negotiation.
Structure your response in this way:
Strategy: Your strategy here
Message: [Your message goes here, with your price proposal or 'terminate' at the end]
Price proposal: xxxxPLN (Enter the number without a comma or decimal point, or write 'terminate' if you don't want to negotiate further.)
